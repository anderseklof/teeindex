# Teeindex - t-shirt quality index

Which t-shirt has the best quality based on shrinkage, shape and color after use and washing?

This index can also be used to find the perfect size by measuring your current favorite t-shirt and comparing it to the table below.

## How to measure

Place the t-shirt on a flat surface.
Make sure the t-shirt is stretched in all directions and has no creases or wrinkles.
Measure with a tape measure.

## How to wash
